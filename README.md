## Analysis List

### Product Analysis
- Analyze different product categories to determine top performers and areas needing improvement.

### Sales Analysis
- Investigate sales trends across different periods and assess the effectiveness of sales strategies.

### Customer Analysis
- Explore customer demographics, purchase behavior, and segment profitability.

### Approach Used
1. **Data Wrangling**: Inspect and clean the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new columns for deeper insights, such as time of day, day of week, and month.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform detailed analysis to answer key questions and uncover patterns.

## Excel Formulas Used

- **Extracting Month**: `=TEXT(A2, "MMM")`
- **Extracting Day**: `=DAY(A2)`
- **Total Profit for October**: `=SUMIF(month_range, "OCT", profit_range)`
- **Profit Percentage**: `=(profit / total_sales) * 100`
- **Average Profit by Month**: `=AVERAGEIFS(profit_range, month_range, month_name)`

## Business Questions Answered

### Generic
- **Unique Regions and States**: Count unique values in `region` and `state` columns.

### Product
- **Most and Least Profitable Categories**: Determine using profit data grouped by `category`.
- **Sales and Profit by Month**: Use `SUMIF` to aggregate data by `month`.

### Sales
- **Sales Trends by Time of Day and Day of the Week**: Analyze using pivot tables or charts for `invoice_time` and `day`.

### Customer
- **Impact of Demographics on Sales**: Analyze using pivot tables or charts for `age`, `gender`, and `category`.

## Revenue And Profit Calculations
- **COGS**: `=quantity * cost_price_per_unit`
- **VAT**: Typically a percentage of COGS
- **Total Sales**: `=VAT + COGS`
- **Gross Margin Percentage**: `=(gross_income / total_sales) * 100`
